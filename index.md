Welcome to my blog. My name is MaÃ«l and I'm a co-founder of [SoundMap](http://soundmap.io/), a smart device that maps the environment of blind and visually impaired people to guide them. I'm a Data Scientist and  Ph.D. student at [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Speech Processing, on [ROXANNE European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/).

I love traveling, and came back from a world tour right before COVID, early 2020. I'm a plant-based sports fan (hiking, fitness, volleyball, javelin..). I love creating things, especially when it implies Machine Learning.

I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Actuarial Science both from the HEC Faculty of University of Lausanne (applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector). I did not really like working in this field, and did a second Master, this time in Data Science, at Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France). I am now a Ph.D. student in Speech Processing at Idiap Research Institute, since  March 2020, and attached to EPFL Electrical Engineering department.

I worked in several startups, especially in NLP, and I've been working as a freelance data scientist on the side of everything else for 3 years now. I started this blog in September 2018, and publish all codes and exercises of this website on GitHub in a dedicated repository:
