I'm the co-founder & ceo of [biped](https://biped.ai/), an assistive device that aims to change the lives of blind and visually impaired people with robotics. I'm a statistician turned data scientist turned entrepreneur. Sharing here some of my thoughts and learnings of the last few years.

I've recently started to share some of my key learnings in:
- a [Notion startup template](https://mael4impact.gumroad.com/l/startupnotion)
- a [30mn call offer](https://calendly.com/mael-fabien/30min)
- and an e-book on impact startups (coming soon)
