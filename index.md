Welcome to my blog. My name is MaÃ«l and I'm a co-founder of [biped](https://biped.ai/), the smartest navigation device for blind and visually impaired people. I currently live in Lausanne, Switzerland.

I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Actuarial Science both from the HEC Faculty of University of Lausanne (applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector). I did a second M.Sc. at Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France) in Data Science and started a Ph.D. in Speech Processing at EPFL in Switzerland. I dropped out of the PhD to launch biped.

Throughout my studies, I worked in various startups, did freelancing, and launched a startup. I'm sharing on this blog some key learnings of these last years. Technical concepts, code snippets, but also some entrepreneurial content! I started this blog in September 2018, and that's the open source blog:
