Welcome to my blog. My name is Maël and I'm a Data Scientist and  Ph.D. student at [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/en) and [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Speech Processing, on [ROXANNE European Project](https://roxanne-euproject.org/).

I love traveling, and came back from a world tour right before COVID, early 2020. I'm a plant-based sports fan (hiking, fitness, volleyball, javelin..). I love creating things, especially software-realted, and entrepreneurship is the way I see my future. After several hackathons and a first startup experience, I've been working for the past few months on [SoundMap](http://soundmap.io/).

I have a B.Sc. in Economics and an M.Sc. in Actuarial Science both from the HEC Faculty of University of Lausanne (applied mathematics and statistics for the insurance sector). I did not really like working in this field, and did a second Master, this time in Data Science, at Telecom Paris (Institut Polytechnique de Paris, France). I am now a Ph.D. student in Speech Processing at Idiap Research Institute, since  March 2020, and attached to EPFL Electrical Engineering department.

I worked in several startups, especially in NLP, and I've been working as a freelance data scientist on the side of everything else for 3 years now. I started this blog in September 2018, and publish all codes and exercises of this website on GitHub in a dedicated repository:

<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/github-cards/latest/widget.js"></script>

I recently launched a newsletter in which I gather some articles I wrote on a topic, interesting Github repositories, projects, papers and more! If you want to stay in the loop, I'll try to send 1 email per month :)
